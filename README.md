### **is a graphic project where we had to implement [raycasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_casting) to bring life in 3d to a map**

## Gameplay

First thing you see in the game is that beautiful **AWP**\
Of course you can shoot with it, it has the ability to break doors from across the map !\
You could still choose to open and close them more calmly when you're near them

## Commands

Here's every command for the game :
- **WASD** to move
- **← →** OR 🖱️ to look around
- **Left Click** to shoot
- **Space** to open/close doors
- **ESC** to leave the game

## Compilation
To compile our project, use the `make` command\
That will make the game launch in *fullscreen*\
\
If unfortunately you encounter a problem with the shell command that retrieve the screen size, or if the game tends to be a bit laggy in fullscreen, you can still use :
- `make midres` to launch the game in 720p
- `make lowres` to launch the game in 480p
